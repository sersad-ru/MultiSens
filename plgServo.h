* GND - GND - black
* VCC - +5V - red
* PWM - P0 - green
*
* Use UP and DOWN button to change the angle.
* Use SELECT button to start rotation.
* Attention! To prevent overload of the device, connect only one servo drive without any load.
* Press and hold SELECT button to store current angle in EEPROM.
* Hold DOWN button and pres RESET to clear stored value and return to defaults. (ATTENTION! All stored data will be cleared. FOR ALL plugins!)
