# PWM Plugin

The PWM plugin creates the PWM signal on `P1`, `P2` and `P3(software PWM)` pins.

* Use the `SELECT` button to change the channel.

* Use the `UP` and `DOWN` button to change duty on selected channel.

* Press and hold the `SELECT` button to store current duty on each channel in the `EEPROM`.

* Hold the `DOWN` button and press `RESET` to clear stored value and return to defaults. 
  (**ATTENTION!** All stored data will be cleared. **FOR ALL** plugins!)
